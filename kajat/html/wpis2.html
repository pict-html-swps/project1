<h3>Red routes improve speed and effectiveness</h3>
</br>

Roads with red lines on them are known as red routes: these are the key road arteries in London. The idea is that these routes need to be kept clear in order for traffic to move smoothly through the capital (we're told that just one driver can clog the roads). Transport for London is uncompromising in its enforcement of parking restrictions on red routes. Make the mistake of stopping your car on a red route to buy your daily paper and traffic wardens converge on you from nowhere.
The motorist's loss proved to be the bus passenger's gain. Research showed that bus journeys were 10% quicker and 27% more reliable. Journey time reliability improved by 20% and red routes led to a 6% reduction in accidents.
Improvements in speed and accuracy need not only apply to bus routes. We can get analogous gains by applying the red route philosophy to web sites. By adopting the role of enthusiastic traffic wardens and treating usability obstacles on red routes like badly behaved motorists, we can ruthlessly eradicate any usability obstacles on the key user journeys. To begin, we need to map out the red routes for our site.

<h3>Red routes describe frequent and critical activities</h3>

In defining red routes, it's important to consider both the frequency and critical nature of the activity. Activities that customers carry out frequently are crucial to the success of the web site since they will determine customers' perception of it. One example of a frequent activity might be search. In contrast, critical activities may be infrequent but users will hate your web site if these tasks are not well supported. An example of an infrequent but critical task might be editing my personal details stored on a web site. Finally, activities that are both frequent and critical are the web site's bread and butter. Get these wrong and you may as well not be in business.
